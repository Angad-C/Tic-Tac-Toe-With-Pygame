# Tic-Tac-Toe With Pygame

The objective of this project was to create a 2 player 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game board. I created this project individually to develop my skill in Python’s Pygame library, and in using and iterating through Python’s data structures.

One of the challenges with this game was to design it so that it can be modified to be a bigger game board if needed and handling various error scenarios.

The game starts by giving the user directions and then lets 2 players take turns playing the game. At each turn, the game checks if someone has won or if there is a tie. I created this project with the AP Create Task rubric in mind and designed it’s functions and data structures to meet its criteria.
